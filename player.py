"""
This is the player class, if you couldn't figure that out.
Basically, this class controls the things to do with the player.

All objects in the engine break down into 3 things:
	- Creation code
	- Step (input) function
	- Destroy
	
__init__() - the create function is called when the player is initialized
instantiating all the variables and other things to do with the player.

update() - the step event, is called once per frame, checks for input, then 
updates the play accordingly.

__del__() - this function is called when the object is destroyed.
Basically, it'll free up memory space and clean things up in order to make sure
The game runs smoothly. Especially with an interpreted language like python,
You have to worry about performance.
